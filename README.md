# CS 320 – Software Testing

## Course Overview
This repository contains projects completed for CS 320: Software Testing. The focus of this course was designing, implementing, and validating back-end services using unit testing with JUnit.

## Project One – Mobile Application Services

For Project One, I developed and tested three core back-end services:

- Contact Service  
- Task Service  
- Appointment Service  

Each service includes:
- An object class with strict input validation
- A service class using in-memory data structures
- Comprehensive JUnit test classes to verify requirements
- Test coverage meeting or exceeding the 80% requirement

The purpose of this project was to ensure that all functionality met clearly defined software requirements through structured unit testing.

## Project Two – Summary and Reflections Report

Project Two includes a written report analyzing:

- My unit testing strategy
- Alignment between requirements and test cases
- Code coverage evaluation
- Testing techniques applied
- Reflection on mindset, bias, and quality discipline in software engineering

This project reinforced the importance of defensive programming, validation logic, and structured automated testing.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JUnit 5
- Eclipse IDE
- In-memory data structures (HashMap)
